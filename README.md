EdgeSense Notify

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO CREATE A SMART VISITOR DETECTION SYSTEM USING THE MAIXDUINO KIT.THIS PROJECT USES A PIR MOTION 
SENSOR TO DETECT MOTION AT THE DOOR,THE CAMERA COMES IN THE KIT CAPTURE AN IMAGE,
AND IT SENDS THE IMAGE TO MAIXDUINO'S K210 CHIP AND IT PERFORM FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION.
IT SENDS NOTIFICATIONS THROUGH MQTT INFORMING THE USER IF A UNKNOWN PERSON IS COME.
HOW THE PROJECT WORKS IS THAT THE PIR MOTION SENSOR DETECTS ANY MOTION
IN ITS RANGE,ONCE MOTION IS DETECTED THE CAMERA CONNECTED TO MAIXDUINO TAKE THE IMAGE OF THE SCENE 
THEN THE MAIXDUINO POWERED USING K210 AI CHIP PROCESS THE IMAGE,THE PRE-TRAINED FACE RECOGNITION MODEL
INSERTED IN THE MAIXDUINO’S SD CARD SLOT USING SD CARD DETECTS IF A FACE IS PRESENT IN IMAGE AND IF A FACE IS 
DETECTED IT COMPARES UNKNOWN FACES AND DETERMINE IF A VISITOR IS THERE OR NOT. AND AT LAST THE BUILT IN ESP32 
MODULE IN THE MAIXDUINO BOARD CONNECTS TO A WIFI AND SENT THE VISITOR ALERT USING MQTT.IF A KNOWN FACE IS DETECTED,
IT SENDS A "KNOWN VISITOR DETECTED" MESSAGE. IF A UNKNOWN FACE IS DETECTED, AN "UNKNOWN VISITOR DETECTED" MESSAGE 
IS SENT TO TH USER MOBILE.HOW THE PROJECT PROCEDURE IS THAT THE PIR MOTION SENSOR IS PLACED NEAR A DOOR. WHEN IT DETECTS
MOTION, IT TRIGGER THE CAMERA.THE CAMERA CAPTURE IMAGE AND SENTS TO MAIXDUINO IT PROCESS IT AND
DETECT UNKNOWN OR KNOWN VISITOR ONCE IT'S DONE THE MESSAGE IS SENT TO USER USING MQTT.
USING THE MAIXDUINO BOARD IN THE PROJECT.K210 AI CHIP ON THE MAIXDUINO
IS THE MAIN PART OF THIS PROJECT. IT HANDLES THE AI TASKS, 
FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION. ONCE AN IMAGE IS CAPTURED BY CAMERA,
K210 CHIP PROCESS THE IMAGE TO DETECT 
FACES AND MATCHES THEM WITH THE PRE-TRAINED DATA TO IDENTIFY
VISITORS.THE BUILT-IN ESP32 MODULE PROVIDES WI-FI TO MAIXDUINO. IT IS USED
FOR CONNECTING THE SYSTEM TO THE LOCAL WI-FI NETWORK AND COMMUNICATING WITH 
THE MQTT TO SEND REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS TO THE USER.THE PIR MOTION SENSOR CONNECTED TO THE MAIXDUINO’S
GPIO PINS ACTIVATE THE ENTIRE PROJECT. IT DETECTS MOTION AND SIGNAL THE CAMERA TO TAKE A PICTURE.
HOW FACE RECOGNITION IS DONE
FACE RECOGNITION WILL BE DONE BY USING THE MAIXDUINO’S K210 AI CHIP, WHICH HAS SUPPORT FOR AI.
I WLL BE USING A PRE-TRAINED FACE RECOGNITION MODEL THAT WILL BE LOADED USING A SD CARD INTO THE MAIXDUINO.I
WILL USE THE PRE-TRAINED FACE RECOGNITION MODEL IN .KMODELFORMAT.THE SYSTEM CAPTURE IMAGES WHEN MOTION IS DETECTED 
THEN RUN FACE DETECTION ON THE CAPTURED IMAGE USING THE K210'S HARDWAREAND RECOGNIZE FACES BY COMPARING THE DETECTED
FACE WITH KNOWN FACES USING A PRE-TRAINED FACE RECOGNITION MODEL AT LAST IT SENDS A NOTIFICATION 
THROUGH MQTT,BASED ON FACE IF IT IS KNOWN OR UNKNOWN.
THE PROJECT CODE IS WRITTEN IN C++ USING THE ARDUINO IDE, AND IT WILL USE SEVERAL LIBRARIES
SIPEED_GC0328 FOR CONTROLLING THE CAMERA.
WIFI FOR CONNECTING TO A WI-FI NETWORK.
PUBSUBCLIENT FOR SENDING MQTT NOTIFICATIONS.
FACE LIBRARY FOR FACE RECOGNITION.
TO LOAD THE FACE RECOGNITION MODEL FROM SD CARD.I AM USING

kpu.begin("/sd/face_model.kmodel");      IN THE CODE.

SO, THAT’S ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
